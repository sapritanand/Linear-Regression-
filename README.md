<h2>Model</h2>
<p>
  The model is based on a simple linear regression algorithm, which predicts the housing price by finding a linear relationship between the input features and the output variable (price). The model is trained using:
  <ul>
    <li>Training data (70%)</li>
    <li>Testing data (30%)</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h2>Evaluation</h2>
<p>
  The model's performance is evaluated using the following metrics:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Mean Squared Error (MSE):</strong> Measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.</li>
    <li><strong>R-squared (R¬≤):</strong> Indicates the proportion of variance in the target variable explained by the features.</li>
  </ul>
  The results can be found in the output of the notebook/script.
